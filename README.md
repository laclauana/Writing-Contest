# Writing contest

## Static website linked to a short story

This is a static website that I designed with the purpose of participating in a writing contest launched by Banco Itau. It was a nice opportunity for me to practice my technical skills combining both my passion for writing and my strong desire to become a well instructed front-end developer. And nothing seems better to me to achieve this goal than creating myself the chances to make it, as well as to accept every challenge that comes ahead, such as this writing contest I've been told about and did not hesitate afterwards to create a whole website from scratch since digital material was also an option to participate in it. 

 ## Technologies used

HTML and CSS so far.
